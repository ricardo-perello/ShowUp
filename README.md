# ShowUp ðŸ’§
## Turn RSVPs into real commitments.

Flaky RSVPs and no-shows waste time, money, and energy for organizers and participants alike. ShowUp solves this with a simple mechanism: staking SUI.

When you sign up for an event, you stake a small deposit. If you show up, you get your stake back â€” plus a share of the no-shows' penalties. If you don't, your stake is redistributed to those who did. Attendance becomes accountability, and commitment is rewarded.

## âœ¨ Features

### For Organizers
- **Create Events**: Define event name, description, location, time, stake amount, and capacity.
- **Vault System**: A vault automatically collects all participant stakes.
- **QR Code Check-in**: Use a QR scanner at the entrance to mark attendees on-chain.
- **Cancellations**: Cancel events before they start; participants automatically get refunds.
- **Transparency**: Live view of participants, attendees, and vault balance.

### For Participants
- **Join Events by Staking**: Commit your spot by staking SUI directly in the event's vault.
- **On-site Check-in**: Show your wallet-generated QR code to prove attendance.
- **Claim Rewards**: After the event ends, claim your stake back â€” plus a share of defaulted deposits.
- **Refunds**: Get your deposit back if the organizer cancels.
- **My Reservations Dashboard**: See all your upcoming and past events, attendance status, and claims.

### Future Extensions (V2+)
- **Geofenced Proof-of-Attendance (POAP)**: Trustless check-in based on being at the event's location, without relying on organizers.
- **Gamification**: Attendance streaks, loyalty scores, and badges.
- **Integration with Calendars & Socials**: Auto-sync events with calendars and social platforms.

## ðŸ”‘ Why It Matters
- **Incentivized Attendance**: People have real skin in the game.
- **Reduced No-Shows**: Organizers save money and resources.
- **Fair Redistribution**: Attendees benefit directly when others don't show.
- **On-Chain Transparency**: Everything is verifiable and trustless.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Built in Move on the Sui blockchain.
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- **Wallets**: Sui Wallet Adapter / compatible wallets.
- **QR System**: qrcode.react for generation, react-qr-reader for scanning.

ShowUp makes events more reliable, fun, and fair â€” powered by Web3 incentives.
