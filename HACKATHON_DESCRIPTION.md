# ShowUp üíß - Turn RSVPs into Real Commitments

## Problem Statement

Event organizers face a critical challenge: **flaky RSVPs and no-shows** that waste time, money, and energy. Traditional RSVP systems lack accountability, leading to:

- **Wasted Resources**: Organizers over-prepare for no-shows
- **Poor Experience**: Attendees miss out due to capacity limits
- **Lost Revenue**: Empty seats that could have been filled
- **Broken Trust**: Unreliable attendance patterns

## Our Solution

**ShowUp** introduces a revolutionary **stake-based commitment system** built on Sui blockchain that transforms how people commit to events.

### How It Works

1. **Stake to Join**: Participants stake SUI tokens to reserve their spot
2. **Show Up**: Attendees get their stake back + share of no-show penalties
3. **No-Show Penalty**: Your stake goes to those who actually attended
4. **Transparent Rewards**: Everything is verifiable on-chain
